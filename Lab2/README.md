<h1>Javascript</h1>
To show that you understand how Javascript works, modify the code that's used in this week's notes example of a form, whose entries are validated and then sent to a php file.  You'll see that there are 3 possible files (based on notes in the test).  The first 2 (example16-1.html, and validatefunctions.js are for an example where you would use 2 separate files to do the work.  However, third file, adduser.php, incorporates javascript, html, and php all into one file. 

What I'd like you to do is go to: http://pld7fall2014.x10.mx/cs334/javascriptsample/ and modify the code in adduser.php, based on the instructions below:

The example collects entered data for the following items: Forename, Surname, Username, Password, Age, Email.  The changes you are to make are:

change "Forename" to "FirstName"

add two additional items to the Signup form (and make sure to carry that through to all appropriate files); the 2 additional items to add are up to you (for example, PhoneNumber, ZipCode, YearOfBirth, Gender, Country, FavoriteMovie, etc.)
