<h1>Looping and Conditionals</h1>
For this lab, write code for the following scenario:

Write a program that prints the numbers from 100 to 1 (decrement); but for multiples of three, print "Hail To" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print " Pitt".  For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "Hail To Pitt".

Assume that you'll be working with integers only.

Don't forget - place your name somewhere in the head or body area of your code; and place a link to a text version of your php code.
