1. create the "Tip of the Day" program, (feel free to use external CSS for the various colors and styles - guide instructions for the lab requirement: lab3_instructions_book_page19.pdf )
2. save a version of your code as a .txt file, and then place a line of html code near the top of the page with a hyperlink to the text file, so that I can review all your php code. (for an example see: http://pld7fall2014.x10.mx/tip.php )
3. upload all the files created for "Tip of the Day" to your remote host, and submit the URL below so I can review your coding.
